[INTRODUCTION]

Lisa: Hey everyone! Welcome back to our English learning podcast. I'm Lisa, your friendly host.

Kevin: And I'm Kevin, your trusty co-host. We're here to help you improve your English skills in a fun and relaxed way.

Lisa: That's right, Kevin. And today, we have a very practical topic for you all - asking for directions.

Kevin: Asking for directions is essential when you're in a new place or when you're lost. So, by the end of this episode, you'll be able to confidently ask for directions in English.

Lisa: Our target level for today's episode is for beginners, specifically A1 to A2 level learners. So, if you're just starting out with English, this episode is perfect for you.

[VOCAULARY PREVIEW]

Lisa: Before we dive into our dialogue, let's go over some key words and phrases related to asking for directions.

Kevin: The first phrase is "Excuse me, can you help me?" This is a polite way to get someone's attention when you need directions.

Lisa: Definitely, Kevin. Another important phrase is "Where is the nearest...?" For example, "Where is the nearest bus stop?" or "Where is the nearest caf√©?"

Kevin: And let's not forget "Turn left" and "Turn right." These phrases will come in handy when you're following someone's directions.

Lisa: Great examples, Kevin. Now, let's see these phrases in action.

[Dialogue]

Lisa: Excuse me, can you help me? I'm looking for the nearest pharmacy.

Kevin: Of course! The nearest pharmacy is just around the corner. Take a left, then you'll see it on your right-hand side.

Lisa: Thank you so much!

Kevin: You're welcome. Have a great day!

[LANGUAGE FOCUS]

Lisa: In that dialogue, we used the phrase "Excuse me, can you help me?" to politely ask for assistance. It's important to be polite when asking for directions.

Kevin: Right, Lisa. And when giving directions, we used the phrases "Take a left" and "on your right-hand side." These phrases help the other person understand which way to go.

Lisa: That's correct, Kevin. And don't forget to say "Thank you" after receiving directions. It's always important to show gratitude.

[Practice Section]

Lisa: Now, let's practice a few variations of our dialogue. Kevin, could you ask me for directions to the nearest bank?

Kevin: Sure! Excuse me, can you help me? I need to find the nearest bank.

Lisa: Of course! Walk straight ahead for two blocks, then turn right. You'll see the bank on your left-hand side.

Kevin: Thanks a lot!

Lisa: You're welcome. Good luck!

Kevin: Lisa, did you notice any cultural differences when it comes to asking for directions?

Lisa: That's a great question, Kevin. In some cultures, people might be more direct and less polite when asking for directions. However, in English-speaking countries, it's always best to be polite and say "Excuse me" or "Please."

[CONCLUSION]

Lisa: Well done, everyone! Today, we learned how to ask for directions in English. Remember to be polite, use the key phrases we discussed, and show gratitude.

Kevin: That's right, Lisa. Practice asking for directions whenever you have the chance. The more you practice, the more confident you'll become.

Lisa: Absolutely, Kevin. And in our next episode, we'll be talking about ordering food at a restaurant. So, stay tuned for that!

Kevin: Thanks for joining us today. We hope you found this episode helpful. See you next time!

Lisa: Take care, and keep practicing your English. Bye!
