[INTRODUCTION]

Lisa: Hey everyone! Welcome back to the English Learning Podcast. I'm Lisa, your friendly host, and with me is Kevin. How are you doing today, Kevin?
Kevin: I'm great, Lisa! Thanks for having me on the show again. I'm excited to talk about today's topic.
Lisa: Me too, Kevin. Today, we're going to learn how to ask for directions in English. It's a really useful skill, especially if you're traveling or new to a city.
Kevin: Absolutely, Lisa. By the end of this episode, our listeners will be able to confidently ask for directions and understand the responses they receive.
Lisa: That's right, Kevin. So let's get started and dive into the vocabulary.

[VOCABULARY PREVIEW]

Lisa: Alright, let's start with the first word: "excuse me." We use this phrase to politely get someone's attention or to ask for assistance.
Kevin: That's right, Lisa. For example, if you're in a busy street and need help, you can say, "Excuse me, could you please tell me how to get to the nearest train station?"
Lisa: Excellent example, Kevin. The next phrase is "turn left." This means to make a left-hand turn while walking or driving.
Kevin: Yes, that's correct, Lisa. For instance, if someone tells you to turn left at the traffic light, it means you need to go in the left direction when you reach the traffic light.
Lisa: Perfect explanation, Kevin. Now, let's move on to "go straight." This means to continue in the same direction without turning.
Kevin: Absolutely, Lisa. For example, if someone tells you to go straight for two blocks, it means you should continue walking in the same direction without taking any turns for two blocks.
Lisa: Great job, Kevin. Our final phrase is "on the right." This means something is located to the right side of your current position.
Kevin: That's correct, Lisa. For instance, if someone tells you that the supermarket is on the right, it means the supermarket is located on the right-hand side of the street.
Lisa: Fantastic examples, Kevin. Now that we've previewed the vocabulary, let's move on to a dialogue where we can see these phrases in action.

[DIALOGUE]

Lisa: Excuse me, can you help me? I'm looking for the nearest post office.
Kevin: Sure, I can help. Turn left at the next intersection, and then go straight for two blocks. The post office will be on your right.
Lisa: Thank you so much! I really appreciate your help.
Kevin: You're welcome! Have a great day.
Lisa: You too!

[LANGUAGE FOCUS]

Lisa: In our dialogue, Kevin used the phrase "turn left." This is an example of giving directions. Kevin, could you explain this phrase a bit more?
Kevin: Of course, Lisa. "Turn left" is used when you want someone to make a left-hand turn. It's important to remember that when you say "turn left," you're referring to the left side from the perspective of the person receiving the directions.
Lisa: That's a great point, Kevin. Another phrase we used was "go straight." Can you explain that one too?
Kevin: Absolutely, Lisa. "Go straight" means to continue in the same direction without turning. It's a straightforward instruction to keep moving forward until you reach your destination.
Lisa: Thanks for explaining that, Kevin. And remember, listeners, if you're unsure about any directions, don't hesitate to ask for clarification. Now, let's move on to our practice section.

[PRACTICE SECTION]

Lisa: Alright, listeners, it's time to practice asking for directions. Kevin, can you give us an example of a different scenario?
Kevin: Sure, Lisa. Imagine you're in a new city and you're looking for a popular restaurant. You can approach someone and say, "Excuse me, could you please tell me how to get to the nearest restaurant?"
Lisa: Great example, Kevin. It's important to be polite when asking for directions. And remember, if you're in a foreign country, it's a good idea to learn a few basic phrases in the local language too.
Kevin: Absolutely, Lisa. Understanding the local culture can make your interactions more pleasant. Now, let's move on to our conclusion.
